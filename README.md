## Weekend Lab Part 2 - Implement Underscore.js Methods

For the second part of your long weekend lab, we'd like you to rewrite some underscore.js methods and tests that make them pass. The functions you will be implementing are:

1. First -  [http://underscorejs.org/#first](http://underscorejs.org/#first)
2. Last - [http://underscorejs.org/#last](http://underscorejs.org/#last)
3. Uniq - [http://underscorejs.org/#uniq](http://underscorejs.org/#uniq)
4. Pluck - [http://underscorejs.org/#pluck](http://underscorejs.org/#pluck)
4. Contains - [http://underscorejs.org/#contains](http://underscorejs.org/#contains)

### How to tackle this assignment

1. First, start with some research, make sure you know exactly what these six functions do before you try to implement it on your own.
2. The "describe" and "it" blocks have been written for you, so start by writing the appropriate tests that match what is inside the "it" block.
3. Once your tests are written, try to write a function that makes the test pass.

### Super bonus

5. Flatten  - [http://underscorejs.org/#flatten](http://underscorejs.org/#flatten) - you will need to use recursion to solve this.

### Final note

Not only is reimplementing JavaScript functions a fantastic way to improve your JS and TDD skills - it's also a super super common interview question, so the more you can practice earlier the better. This is going to be challenging, but if you get stuck, move to the next function or use each other and Stack Overflow to help. We will review everything after the long weekend, so if you are struggling, don't get discouraged!
